"Hello, Potion Seller, I am going into battle and I want your strongest potions."

"My potions are too strong for you, traveler."

"Potion Seller, I tell you I am going into battle, and I want only your strongest potions."

"You can't handle my potions. They're too strong for you."

"Potion Seller, listen to me; I want only your strongest potions."

"My potions would kill you, traveler. You cannot handle my potions."

"Potion Seller, enough of these games. I'm going into battle and I need your strongest potions."

"My strongest potions would kill you, traveler. You can't handle my strongest potions. You'd better go to a seller that sells weaker potions."

"Potion Seller, I'm telling you right now; I'm going into battle and I need only your strongest potions."

"You don't know what you ask, traveler. My strongest potions will kill a dragon let alone a man. You need a seller that sells weaker potions, because my potions are too strong."
